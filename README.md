# Assembler Project in C

## Overview

A robust, modular assembler written in C that translates assembly language into machine code.  
This project demonstrates expertise in systems programming, compiler construction, and software engineering best practices.

- Implements lexical analysis, preprocessing, two-pass assembly, error detection, and machine code generation.  
- Designed for maintainability, extensibility, and clarity.

## Technologies & Tools

- Language: C (ISO C99)  
- Build system: Makefile with GCC  
- Development environment: Linux/Unix compatible  
- Key concepts: Compiler design, parsing, symbol tables, memory management, error handling

## Build & Run Instructions

### Build

```bash
make
```

### Run

```bash
./assembler <source_file.asm>
```

Processes the input assembly file and outputs machine code or reports errors.

### Clean

```bash
make clean
```
